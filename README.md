# System-On-Chip-Design-
Project completed in final year as part of System on Chip Design Module. We had to create a game that would be uploaded onto a FPGA. There was an LED display that would display the game and user inputs were allowed. The player had to catch a falling ball in a basket. The speed at which the ball falls increases as the player completes each level and makes each successful catch. The score is displayed and the level.
